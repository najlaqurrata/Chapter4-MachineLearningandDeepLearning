# Chapter4-MachineLearningandDeepLearning
On this project, I have 3 task + bonus task. First, creating the best prediction model to predict “Churn Status in Banking”, and it must have > 86% Accuracy for predict, and second creating the best number of clusters for “Random Points”, and it must have > 70 Silhouette Score. In Task 3, we create a PyTorch workflow for non-convolutional MNIST digit classification. And for the Bonus Task involves comparing model configurations, loss, and activation functions for performance evaluation.

## Assignment Outcomes :
Participants can perform Data Segmentation with Clustering method, participants can perform and compare several Supervised Learning models, participants can design and build a simple neural network (not CNN, but with perceptron model) for MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset.participants can segment data using the clustering method


### Task 1
Creating the best prediction model to predict “Churn Status in Banking”.

*** Scoring ***
● Getting Best Accuracy > 86% : 100

● Getting Best Accuracy 85% - 86%: 85

● Getting Best Accuracy 84% - 85%: 70

● Getting Best Accuracy <84% : 55

● Any error in the code will become 0.


### Task 2
Creating the best number of clusters for “Random Points”.

*** Scoring ***
● Getting Best Silhouette Score > 70: 100
● Getting Best Silhouette Score 65-70: 85
● Getting Best Silhouette Score 60-65: 70
● Getting Best Silhouette Score <65: 55
● Any error in the code will become 0.

### Task 3
Deep Learning for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using PyTorch. This is an exploration task. Develop your end-to-end workflow for solving a Handwritten Digit Classification task using Neural Network architecture (not Convolutional Neural Network).

### Bonus Task
This problem description is the same as Task 3. But there are some technical challenges that you have to choose one.
1. Compare 3 different configurations while your model is wider/deeper. Show and explain the performance result.
2. Compare 3 configurations for different Loss Function. Show and explain your performance result.
3. Compare 3 configurations for the activation function. Show and explain your performance result.


### Chapter 3 overview:

Task 1: Preprocessed, cleaned, and correlated data. Trained three machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)) to compare their accuracy.

Task 2: Applied KMeans clustering to create the best cluster from the dataset.

Task 3: Created a Deep Learning model using the PyTorch library to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Bonus Task: Created three different configurations for comparison, including variations in loss and activation functions.
